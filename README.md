# Fuzzy_searching

This projects involves taking a excel sheet input of choices of professions which happened to be incorrectly spelled in multiple ways. So, the task is to make an algorithm to fuzzy search the list and to display the resulting corrected data as a bar graph.

In this project, I decided to aplly three different fuzzy searching algorithms, Levenshtein, Bitap, and N-gram and find the individual corrected data from each and compare the three results to see which algorithm is the best for searching through such a list if values.
